# Friday Night Funkin' - BooleanPsychEngine
## Introduction
This fnf engine is just a modification of Psych Engine 0.6.3, which means you can just load most of the mods loaded on the Psych Engine 0.6.3 in this engine.

### Following functions are new in this engine:
  1. New Replay system
  2. Victory Screen  (you can choose an option to skip it in options-BoolPE Setting)
  3. Combo counter and msTiming (you can change or hide in options-BoolPE Setting)
  4. 5 level judgements (add "Perfect" level whose window is 20ms)
  5. Different health gaining between different judgements(change the value in options-BoolPE Setting)  
  6. New score and accuracy judging algorithm.(the score and accuracy you get are not only based on the judgements but also the time offset)
  7. Add Sick combo
  8. AutoPause option
  9. HealthDrain option
  10. Some UI changes.

 ### How to use the replay system?
   To enable the replay saving system,you must enable the victory screen.
   When the victory screen shows, press F3.
   Save the file in folder /replays (if this folder not exists, just create a new one)
   
   Next time you want to load, choose the song and difficuity in freeplay and then press F2.
   and press UP/Down to select the files, enter to load.
## Installation
  Actually the same as the installiation of Psych Engine 0.6.3. And details will be wrote in the future.

### This modification is all made by myself, so there may be some bugs and some codes may not perfect. Hoping for your advice!
